DONE

*	. and -> can now be used interchangedly
*	don't need to use the "struct" keyword in variable decl
*	added typeid() for runtime access to a type ID
*	multiline strings (was already a thing in TCC!)
*	default binary output name same as first filename argument minus extension
*	#product "compiled_file_name"
*	assignment warnings now actually show the types that are in conflict in verify_assign_cast()
*	assigning a struct pointer to a basic type without casting is now an error
*	default to sane basic type names (u8 etc) [sort of, just typedefs for now]
*	change compiler flags with # directives
	* #product "NAME_OF_OUTPUT_FILE" (same as the -o cmd line switch)
	* #library "LIBRARY_PATH_TO_ADD" (same as the -L cmd line switch)
	* #link "LINK_LIBRARY_FILE" (same as the -l cmd line switch)

OPEN
*	capy strings
*	string interpolation
*	function signature matching
*	type reflection at runtime
*	polymorphism
*	compile-time code execution / metaprogramming
*	defer things for when symbols go out of scope?
*	generics?
*	var keyword for type inference?
